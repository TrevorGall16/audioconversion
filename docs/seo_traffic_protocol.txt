SEO_TRAFFIC_PROTOCOL

Purpose:
This document provides the universal protocol for building high-ranking, indexable websites. It defines how to simulate multi-page architecture for crawlers, regardless of the technology stack used.
Rules should be followed but are not strict. if you need to break or not follow a rule for this website, feel free to do so.

1. CORE PHILOSOPHY

Speed is Ranking: TTFB < 200ms, LCP < 2.5s.

Zero "Soft 404s": Every navigable content piece must have a unique, indexable URL.

Virtual Routing: The application must update the browser History API and Page Metadata on every view change.

2. ARCHITECTURE PROTOCOLS (SELECT ONE)

The Builder AI must determine the Tech Stack from TechStackGuideline.md and apply the matching protocol below.

Protocol A: The "Vanilla Lite" (Client-Side / No Build)

Applies when using: Vanilla JS, jQuery, plain HTML/CSS.

File Structure: index.html, app.js, style.css (Root only).

Routing: Use history.pushState() manually.

Initialization: On window.onload, parse window.location.search to determine content.

Google Visibility: Google does not click buttons. All clickable items must be <a href="?item=slug"> or managed via pushState with a fallback.

Protocol B: The "Modern Framework" (Next.js / Astro / Svelte)

Applies when using: Next.js, Astro, React Router, SvelteKit.

Routing: NEVER use history.pushState manually. Use the framework's router (e.g., next/navigation, react-router-dom).

Rendering: Prefer Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) for content pages.

Hydration: Ensure metadata (Title, Meta Description) is updated by the framework's head manager (e.g., Next.js generateMetadata).

3. DATA STRUCTURING FOR SEO

3.1 Slug Rule (MANDATORY)

Every distinct object (product, calculator result, directory item) must have a slug.

BAD: ?id=123

GOOD: ?item=camera-lens (Vanilla) or /item/camera-lens (Framework)

3.2 Sitemap Logic

Vanilla Projects: Create a standalone script (e.g., scripts/generate_sitemap.js) that reads the JSON data and outputs sitemap.xml to root.

Framework Projects: Use the framework's sitemap generation tools (e.g., next-sitemap or a sitemap.ts route).

4. GLOBAL INDEXING STRATEGY

4.1 The "One Page" Trap

Single Page Apps (SPAs) appear to Google as 1 page unless explicit routes exist.

Requirement: Ensure direct access to any deep URL (e.g., domain.com/?item=slug) loads the specific item immediately without user interaction.

4.2 Internal Linking Protocol

Rule: For high-value static content blocks on the homepage (FAQ, Knowledge Basics), use internal jump links (e.g., <a href="#faq-section">FAQ</a>) in the header/footer to provide anchor links. This simulates deep-linking and increases the crawl depth of the primary page.

4.3 Robots.txt

Standard configuration:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: [Insert Production URL]/sitemap.xml
