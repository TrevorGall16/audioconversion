ADS_AND_INDEXING_GUIDELINES

This document defines exact rules for generating your website's Ads Placement Strategy and Indexing / SEO Strategy.
Rules should be followed but are not strict. if you need to break or not follow a rule for this website, feel free to do so.
1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

The AI reading this document must understand:

Google AdSense Strictness: Tool/Utility sites are often rejected for "Low Value Content". This document prevents that.

Where ads must appear (Placement Strategy).

How ads must be implemented based on the Tech Stack (Vanilla vs. Framework).

How the website must be indexed for maximum search visibility.

2. OUTPUT FORMAT

When an AI writes the "Ads & Indexing" document, it must follow this structure exactly:

AdSense Compliance Strategy (The "High-Value" Rule)

Ads Strategy Summary

Ad Placements (Visual Rules)

Ad Behavior Logic (Technical Implementation)

Indexing Strategy Summary

Technical SEO Requirements

Metadata Requirements

Sitemap & Robots Rules

Schema Markup Requirements

3. ADSENSE COMPLIANCE STRATEGY (CRITICAL)

To avoid "Low Value Content" rejection, the Architect AI must enforce the following Content-First rules:

3.1 The "High-Value" Homepage Rule

Prohibition: The homepage MUST NOT consist only of inputs, buttons, or a search bar.

Requirement: The initial view (Main Container) must contain 300-500 words of static, helpful content visible immediately.

Content Types: "How to use this tool", "Methodology", "Common Rules", or "FAQ".

Reasoning: Google bots do not click buttons. If the value only appears after interaction, the bot sees an empty page.

3.2 The "Content Silo Protocol" (Audio Converter Specific)

Rule: Long-form, highly searchable content (FAQ, Knowledge Basics) must remain physically present on the homepage for AdSense value but should be modularized using a Build Script Injection approach (as implemented in build.js). This keeps the visual content density high while maintaining a small template.html file size.

Requirement: Every major static content block (e.g., FAQ) must be wrapped in a semantic HTML tag and given a unique ID (e.g., <section id="faq-section">) for deep-linking.

3.3 The "Reset" Protocol

Logic: When a user resets the tool or clicks "Back":

Path A (Vanilla): The resetToHome() function must re-inject the full text block (from 3.1). It must NEVER leave the container empty.

Path B (Framework): The home route must always render the text component by default.

4. ADS STRATEGY GUIDELINES

4.1 Principles

Ads must never be intrusive.

Ads must blend visually but remain identifiable.

Ads must follow responsiveness rules.

4.2 Types of Allowed Ads

The AI may generate documentation that includes:

Banner Ads (horizontal)

Square Ads (box / tile)

Native In-feed Ads

4.3 Placement Logic (Mandatory Visual Patterns)

The AI must always follow these rules regarding location:

A. Forbidden Areas (Strict)

NO ADS in the Navigation Panel / Sidebar (Left Panel).

NO ADS on screens that have no publisher content (e.g., a loading screen or empty result state).

NO ADS that disappear when the user interacts (causes layout shift violations).

B. Header Area

1 banner allowed.

Must never push down the main navigation.

C. Main Page Content (Right Panel)

Insert ads after text blocks or below specific results.

Minimum spacing: 500–700 px vertical distance.

Max 3 ads per page view.

D. Mobile Rules

Max 1–2 ads visible at any time.

Ads must respect viewport height (no >25% of screen).

4.4 Technical Implementation (CRITICAL)

The AI must define the implementation method based on the chosen Tech Stack:

IF PATH A (Vanilla JS):

Method: Manual DOM Injection.

Logic: On navigation (virtual route change), the code must explicitly clear the .ad-container HTML and re-run the ad script.

Class: Use a global AdManager class.

IF PATH B (Next.js / Framework):

Method: Component-based.

Logic: Wrap ads in an <AdUnit /> component.

Refresh: Use useEffect (React) to detect route changes and trigger a refresh of the specific ad slot.

Constraint: NEVER use innerHTML or document.write.

4.5 CLS Prevention (All Stacks)

All ad containers must have a CSS min-height (e.g., 250px) to reserve space before the ad loads.

Deployment Rule: When a container is empty (during debugging or after ad fails), the container must collapse visually (e.g., background: transparent; border: none; and set height to 0 using CSS for visual cleanliness) while maintaining the reserved min-height space to prevent layout shifts.

5. INDEXING & SEO STRATEGY

5.1 Indexing Guidelines

The AI must:

Define how crawlers navigate the site.

Explicitly state which pages are indexed vs noindexed.

5.2 URL Structure Rules

Use clean, lowercase, hyphen-separated URLs.

Path A (Vanilla): Use query slugs (?item=camera-lens).

Path B (Framework): Use path slugs (/item/camera-lens).

5.3 Title & Meta Description Rules

Titles: 50–60 characters.

Descriptions: 140–160 characters.

Dynamic Update:

Vanilla: document.title = ...

Framework: Use export const metadata or <Head> tags.

5.4 Header Structure Rules

H1 = Page Title (Only one per view)

H2 = Section Title

H3 = Sub-section

6. TECHNICAL SEO REQUIREMENTS

Lighthouse Targets:

Performance: >90

SEO: >95

Images: All images must include alt text and explicit width/height.

Lazy Loading: Native loading="lazy" on all images below the fold.

7. SITEMAP & ROBOTS RULES

7.1 Sitemap

Must include all indexable pages (or slugs).

Generation:

Path A: Custom Node/Bun script.

Path B: Framework-native sitemap generation.

7.2 Robots.txt

Allow list.

Disallow list for private pages.

Link to Sitemap.

8. SCHEMA MARKUP RULES

The AI must generate schema.org markup using JSON-LD.
Required:

WebSite

WebPage

BreadcrumbList
