ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDELINES.md

For: AI Assistants / Developers
Goal: Systematically catch, log, and resolve errors to maintain user experience and SEO.
Rules should be followed but are not strict. if you need to break or not follow a rule for this website, feel free to do so.

General Philosophy

Prevent silent failures.

Separate user-facing messages ("Something went wrong") from developer logs.

Error Categories & Handling

A. Data Errors (Missing Fields/Slugs)

Action: Fallback to a default value or hide the specific element.

Critical: Do not crash the entire page if one item is missing a tag.

B. Navigation Errors

Path A (Vanilla): Catch history.pushState errors. If URL parsing fails, redirect to Home.

Path B (Framework): Use error.tsx (Next.js) or Error Boundaries to catch route failures.

C. Ad Errors

Action: If an ad fails to load, collapse the container height safely or show a placeholder.

Log: Retry initialization once, then stop.

Visual Rule (CSS): Ad containers must have a reserved min-height (CLS prevention). When the ad fails or is empty, remove background/borders and set height to 0 or use overflow: hidden; to collapse the visual debug state while maintaining the reserved space defined by the min-height property.

Error Logging

Maintain a local log or console group during development.

Format: [Error Type] - [Component/File] - Message.

Recovery Strategies

Rendering Failures:

Path A: Try-Catch blocks around DOM manipulation.

Path B: React Error Boundaries around complex components.

Network Failures:

Retry critical fetches 1 time.

If failing, show "Offline" or "Cached" state.

Testing & QA

Simulate a "Missing Data" scenario (delete a field in JSON).

Simulate a "Broken URL" scenario.

Ensure the "Back" button works after an error.
