Audio Converter Website — Build Specification & Technology Document
1. Project Goal

Create a lightweight, fast, SEO-friendly audio converter website with stable ad placement, high visibility, maximum indexing potential, and a simple, maintainable codebase.
The system must prioritize:
- Speed
- Security & Cost Control
- Clean HTML structure
- Mobile responsiveness
- Ad compliance (GDPR/CCPA)

2. Recommended Technology Stack
2.1 Frontend
- HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript
- Keeps everything lightweight and indexable
- No heavy frameworks unless necessary
- Instant page loads and maximum Core Web Vitals performance
- User Interaction: Must support **Drag & Drop** for file uploads with visual feedback (e.g., border change on hover).

2.2 Conversion Engine
Choose one of the two safe approaches depending on capabilities:
Option A — Server-Side FFmpeg (Recommended)
- Use FFmpeg on the backend for actual audio conversion
- Supports all major formats
- Stable, fast, predictable
- Better control and less browser memory usage
- Safe for large files

Option B — Browser-Side FFmpeg.wasm (Alternative)
- Runs entirely in browser memory
- No server processing
- Lower hosting cost
- But: higher CPU load for users and less consistent performance

If unsure, Option A (server-side FFmpeg) is the best balance between control, stability, and safety.

3. Backend Layer
If using server-side:
- Node.js with Express (Fast setup, lightweight)
- Python FastAPI or PHP (alternatives)

Backend responsibilities:
- Validate file or URL input
- Process conversion with FFmpeg
- Return downloadable file
- Log conversions (optional analytics)

4. Hosting & Deployment
Prioritize:
- Fast CDN (Cloudflare recommended)
- HTTPS automatically enabled
- Minimal server logic
- Caching of static assets (HTML/CSS/JS)

Deployment suggestions:
- Netlify or Vercel for frontend
- Railway / Fly.io / Render for backend with FFmpeg
- Cloudflare Pages + Worker backend if going serverless

Focus is always on: Ease of maintenance, high uptime, cheap hosting tiers.

5. SEO & Indexing Strategy
To maximize visibility and ranking:
- Static HTML where possible (SSG approach preferred)
- Clean URL structure (e.g., /mp3-to-wav/)
- H1/H2 hierarchy properly used
- Super fast load time (<1 s)
- No layout shifting (CLS)
- Semantic tags: <main> <section> <article> <nav>
- Fully responsive layout

6. Ad Stability, Compliance & Technical Implementation
Ad Loading Method:
- Use Google AdSense or AdManager
- Ads must load asynchronously
- Reserve space (static height) for each ad container to prevent CLS.

**MANDATORY: GDPR & CCPA Compliance (Consent Mode)**
- Implement a lightweight "Cookie Consent" modal on the first visit.
- **Critical Rule:** The AdProvider must NOT load any ads until the user clicks "Accept".
- Store consent status in localStorage.
- If consent is denied, ads must remain hidden, but the tool must still work.

Ad Containers in Code:
- Each location should have a dedicated <div id="ad-slot-X"></div>.
- Keep all ad scripts in one central file (AdProvider).

7. Security & Cost Control Practices
- **Hard File Limit:** Enforce a strict 50MB (or similar) limit on uploads to prevent server crashes and high bandwidth costs.
- **Frontend Validation:** Alert the user immediately if the file is too big before uploading.
- **Auto-Cleanup:** The backend must have a cron job or timeout that automatically deletes uploaded and converted files after 15 minutes.
- Use HTTPS everywhere.
- Sanitize file names (remove special characters).
- Rate limit IP addresses to prevent abuse.

8. Performance Optimization
- Minify CSS and JS
- Compress images
- Preload fonts
- Use lazy loading where possible
- Cache common assets aggressively
- Keep the site under 100 KB total payload excluding ads

9. Accessibility
- Large buttons
- Clear copy
- Simple color contrast
- Support small screens
- Keyboard-navigable form fields

10. Recommended Directory Structure
/public
   index.html
   /css
   /js
   /assets
/server
   ffmpeg-handler.js
   validator.js
   cleanup.js  <-- New auto-delete script
   server.js
/config
   ads.js
   settings.json
