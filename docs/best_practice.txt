BEST_PRACTICES_GUIDELINES.md

For: AI Assistants / Developers
Goal: Ensure all websites follow consistent, high-quality development patterns for maintainability, SEO, speed, and scalability.
Rules should be followed but are not strict. if you need to break or not follow a rule for this website, feel free to do so.
Project Organization

Directory Structure: Strictly follow the structure defined in the TechStackGuideline.md for the specific project type (Vanilla vs Framework). Do not invent new folders.

Imports:

Frameworks: Use path aliases (@/components/...) if configured.

Vanilla: Use relative paths (./utils.js).

File Size: Keep files small and focused (max ~300 lines if possible).

Large Content Management: For static sites using a build script, large content blocks (FAQ, Tutorials, etc.) must be moved into external HTML partials/snippets (e.g., /content_blocks/) and injected by the build script (build.js) into the master template. The master template (template.html) itself should remain under 500 lines.

Coding Standards

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple, readable code over complex optimizations.

DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): Reuse functions, components, and patterns.

Formatting: Always format code after each task (bun format or project-specific formatter).

Docstrings: Include clear docstrings for functions, classes, and components describing: Purpose, Inputs & outputs, Side effects.

Component & UI Practices

Reusability: Create reusable components (buttons, modals, loaders).

Naming: Follow consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for Components, camelCase for functions).

Styling: Check existing files for style patterns before adding new CSS.

Accessibility: Ensure components are responsive and accessible (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

Validation: Use prop validation (TypeScript interfaces or PropTypes).

Performance & Speed

Dependencies: Minimize external libraries. Only include what is strictly necessary.

Assets: Optimize images (WebP/AVIF) and use lazy loading (loading="lazy").

Scripts: Avoid blocking JS; defer non-critical scripts.

Bundles: Ensure fast build times and minimal bundle size (< 100KB initial load for Frameworks, < 50KB for Vanilla).

SEO & Indexing

Source of Truth: Refer to SEO_TRAFFIC_PROTOCOL.md for exact implementation details regarding routing and meta-tags.

URLs: Ensure unique, shareable URLs for each data item.

Metadata: Dynamic updates of document.title and <meta> tags on virtual routing (or framework equivalent).

Semantics: Use semantic HTML (<main>, <section>, <article>) for better indexing.

Version Control & Collaboration

Commits: Commit early and often; use descriptive messages starting with a verb.

Branches: Create feature branches for larger tasks.

Logs: Document all major changes in logs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md.

Testing & Validation

Coverage: Always write tests for new features: component tests, API tests, and logic validation.

Mock Data: Include mock data for testing UI without backend.

Automation: Automate testing where possible (bun test or equivalent).

QA: Validate SEO tags, performance (Lighthouse), and accessibility regularly.

Security Best Practices

Secrets: Never store API keys or secrets in frontend code.

Input: Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

Errors: Ensure robust error handling to prevent leaking system info to users.

Documentation & Instructions

Maintenance: Maintain clear documentation for each component, module, and feature.

AI Guides: Include guides for AI assistants if code generation is automated.

Logs: Maintain a common mistakes / lessons learned log.

Continuous Improvement

Reflect on project outcomes and iterate on best practices.
