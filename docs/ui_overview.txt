UI & Ad Placement Specification (Enhanced Ad Version)
Those are just general recommendations. It doesn't have to be followed strictly.

Purpose
Defines UI layout and ad strategy for the audio converter website with increased ad density without violating basic usability or ad network policies.

UI Layout Overview
Main sections:

Header

Conversion Module

Ad Blocks (multiple)

Results Module

Secondary Info

Footer

Sidebar Ad (desktop only)

Core UI (Conversion Module)
Components:

URL Input (large, centered)

Format Dropdown

Convert Button

Minimal error states
This is the “hero” area—must stay perfectly clean, untouched by ads.

Final Ad Placement Strategy
You now have a Max 4-ad structure.

CRITICAL DEVELOPER NOTE: While some ads are "logic-triggered" (hidden until conversion), during the BUILD phase, all ad containers must have a "debug mode" or distinct placeholders (borders/colors) that are visible in the code structure so the user can verify layout. Do not use 'display: none' permanently in the CSS for testing.

A. Banner Ad #1 — Top Banner (Above Conversion Box)

Full-width banner

Always present

Loads on page load

Space is reserved to avoid layout jumps

B. Banner Ad #2 — Mid-Page Banner (Below Results)

Production Behavior: Appears after conversion result.

Development Behavior: Keep the container strictly defined in the DOM. Even if empty or hidden via JS, the CSS class should allow for visibility testing (e.g., via a .debug class).

Positioned between the download button and the secondary info section.

C. Sidebar Ad — Desktop Only (Right and/or Left)

Vertical rectangle

Sticky within a static reserved column

Never covers UI

Loads on page load

Mobile: Hidden completely via CSS media queries.

D. Optional Conversion Trigger Ad

Tiny inline rectangle

Production Behavior: Appears after user hits “Convert”.

Positioned below the progress bar.

Must NOT delay or block conversion.

Behavioral Rules for Ads

6.1 Page Load Rules

Banner #1 loads immediately.

Sidebars load immediately (desktop).

No modals, no pop-windows, no forced interaction.

6.2 Conversion Trigger Rules

Each conversion is a “page refresh event”.

Banner #2 may refresh on each conversion.

Inline ad may appear every conversion.

6.3 Safety Rules (Google Compliant)

Ads never mimic buttons.

Ads never cover UI.

No uncloseable overlays.

Sidebar must be coded as part of layout, not floating over content.

6.4 COLLAPSE RULE (NEW)

CSS Requirement: When the ad container is empty (or the ad fails to load in production), the associated CSS class must remove borders and backgrounds and set padding: 0; margin-top: 0; to visually collapse the container (though the CLS-preventing min-height remains).

Mobile Rules

Sidebars hidden (display: none).

Banners switch to mobile format.

Inline ad becomes very small or horizontal.

Never push the convert button off-screen.

Final UX Summary
You get:

Clear conversion flow

Multiple monetization surfaces

No breakage

A standard “converter site” ad density.
