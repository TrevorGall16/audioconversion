UI & Ad Placement Specification (Enhanced Ad Version)
Those are just general recommendation. It doesn't have to be followed strictly
1. Purpose

Defines UI layout and ad strategy for the audio converter website with increased ad density without violating basic usability or ad network policies.

2. UI Layout Overview

Main sections:

Header

Conversion Module

Ad Blocks (multiple)

Results Module

Secondary Info

Footer

Optional Sidebar Ad (desktop only)

3. Core UI (Conversion Module)
Components

URL Input (large, centered)

Format Dropdown

Convert Button

Minimal error states

This is the “hero” area—must stay perfectly clean, untouched by ads.

4. Final Ad Placement Strategy

You now have a Max 4-ad structure, fully acceptable and common in converter websites:

A. Banner Ad #1 — Top Banner (Below Conversion Box)

Full-width banner

Always present

Loads on page load

Space is reserved to avoid layout jumps

B. Banner Ad #2 — Mid-Page Banner (Below Results)

Appears after conversion result

Positioned between the download button and the secondary info section

Only visible after a conversion is performed

Allowed to refresh each time a new conversion finishes

C. Sidebar Ad — Desktop Only (Right or Left)

Vertical rectangle

Sticky within a static reserved column

Never covers UI

Never floats over content

Loads on page load

Does NOT refresh on its own

On mobile, hidden completely

D. Optional Conversion Trigger Ad

Tiny inline rectangle

Appears after user hits “Convert”

Positioned below the progress bar (never above it)

Must NOT delay or block conversion

Auto-dismisses once progress hits 100%

Total possible ads at once (desktop): 3 banners + 1 small inline
Total on mobile: 2 banners + 1 small inline

This is perfectly normal for downloader/converter websites.

Ads never mimic buttons

Ads never cover UI

Ads never move the UI unpredictably

No redirecting

No uncloseable overlays

No ad stacking inside paragraphs

Sidebar must be coded as part of layout, not floating over content

7. Mobile Rules

Sidebar hidden

Banners switch to mobile format

Inline ad becomes very small or horizontal

Never push the convert button off-screen

No sticky ads

Clear conversion flow

Multiple monetization surfaces
