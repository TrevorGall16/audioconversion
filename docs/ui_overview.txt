UI & Ad Placement Specification (Enhanced Ad Version)
Those are just general recommendations. It doesn't have to be followed strictly.

1. Purpose
Defines UI layout and ad strategy for the audio converter website with increased ad density without violating basic usability or ad network policies.

2. UI Layout Overview
Main sections:
- Header
- Conversion Module
- Ad Blocks (multiple)
- Results Module
- Secondary Info
- Footer
- Sidebar Ad (desktop only)

3. Core UI (Conversion Module)
Components:
- URL Input (large, centered)
- Format Dropdown
- Convert Button
- Minimal error states
This is the “hero” area—must stay perfectly clean, untouched by ads.

4. Final Ad Placement Strategy
You now have a Max 4-ad structure.

**CRITICAL DEVELOPER NOTE:** While some ads are "logic-triggered" (hidden until conversion), during the BUILD phase, all ad containers must have a "debug mode" or distinct placeholders (borders/colors) that are visible in the code structure so the user can verify layout. Do not use 'display: none' permanently in the CSS for testing.

A. Banner Ad #1 — Top Banner (Above Conversion Box)
- Full-width banner
- Always present
- Loads on page load
- Space is reserved to avoid layout jumps

B. Banner Ad #2 — Mid-Page Banner (Below Results)
- Production Behavior: Appears after conversion result.
- Development Behavior: Keep the container strictly defined in the DOM. Even if empty or hidden via JS, the CSS class should allow for visibility testing (e.g., via a .debug class).
- Positioned between the download button and the secondary info section.

C. Sidebar Ad — Desktop Only (Right and/or Left)
- Vertical rectangle
- Sticky within a static reserved column
- Never covers UI
- Loads on page load
- Mobile: Hidden completely via CSS media queries.

D. Optional Conversion Trigger Ad
- Tiny inline rectangle
- Production Behavior: Appears after user hits “Convert”.
- Positioned below the progress bar.
- Must NOT delay or block conversion.

6. Behavioral Rules for Ads

6.1 Page Load Rules
- Banner #1 loads immediately.
- Sidebars load immediately (desktop).
- No modals, no pop-windows, no forced interaction.

6.2 Conversion Trigger Rules
- Each conversion is a “page refresh event”.
- Banner #2 may refresh on each conversion.
- Inline ad may appear every conversion.

6.3 Safety Rules (Google Compliant)
- Ads never mimic buttons.
- Ads never cover UI.
- No uncloseable overlays.
- Sidebar must be coded as part of layout, not floating over content.

7. Mobile Rules
- Sidebars hidden (display: none).
- Banners switch to mobile format.
- Inline ad becomes very small or horizontal.
- Never push the convert button off-screen.

8. Final UX Summary
You get:
- Clear conversion flow
- Multiple monetization surfaces
- No breakage
- A standard “converter site” ad density.
